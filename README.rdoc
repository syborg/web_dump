= web_dump

Little tiny class to easily save and retrieve web pages

In web related client applications, such as spiders, it is frequently necessary 
to save pages into files with adecuate naming convention. WebDump comes to the
rescue. It manages the details of assigning unique readable names and save files
after URIs that have been visited. Additionally, saving data could also be
conveniently compressed with gzip for deep web spidering. It only depends on
telling the correct file extension when saving.

Conversely, file read operation is available through convenient methods
indicating either a pathname or a URI.

== Installation

  $ sudo gem install web_dump

The main source repository is http://github.com/syborg/web_dump.

== Usage

First of all ...

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'web_dump'

Instantiate an object. You may add some options that can be passed through an
array

  wd = WebDump,new :base_dir => '~/mydir', :file_ext => '.gz'

`wd`, when asked to, will save all files inside expanded directory '~/mydir'
with an appended file extension at the end '.gz' (if not overwriten later)

Other options could be passed when instantiating an object.

* `:file_ext => extension` (String that will be appended at the end to every filename if not changed from _save_ method)

Most of them are also passed along to an UriPathname object that is created.

* `:base_dir => dir_name` (directory where everything will be stored. Defaults to '~/web_dumps')
* `:pth_sep => psep` (String that will be used to substitute '/' inside URI's path and queries (defaults to UriPathname::PTH_SEP='_|_'))
* `:host_sep => hsep` (String that will be used separate the URIÂ¡s hostname and path when constructing the pathname. if '/' is used, hostname will actually become a subdirectory -defaults to UriPathname::HOST_SEP='__|'-)
* `:no_path => nopath` (String that will be used as a path placeholder when no URI's path exists, -default UriPathname::NO_PTH = '_NOPATH_'-)

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
